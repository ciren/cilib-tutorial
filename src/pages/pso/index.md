# PSO

The particle swarm optimization library of CILib is one of the most extensive libraries.
While offering numerous pso components and algorithms it's best to begin with the basics of the library and then progressively work from there.

To include this library in your project you can add the following to your list of library dependencies

`"net.cilib" %% "cilib-pso" % "2.0.1"`

There are also several examples of implementations of PSOs in the example package. You can view the example package [here][example-package].
