# Setting Up Your Work Environment {#sec:setting-up}

This section will take you through setting an sbt project to include CILib.
If you're more of a IDE programmer, don't worry, we've got you covered. We will look at setting up CILib in both an IDE environment as well as a text editor and terminal based environment. After we have our structure set up, we will look at modules from CILib that we will be able to add to our list of library dependencies. 

*Note: You need Java in order for Scala to compile so make sure you have a jdk installed.*
